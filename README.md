# sigma lang by dimini171

# what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.   
it aims to be a wrapper for python with a slightly edited syntax. 
it tries to be very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.
