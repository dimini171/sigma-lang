# THIS IS **NOT** A FINISHED PRODUCT. A (barely) WORKING PROTOTYPE CAN BE FOUND [HERE](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1)

# sigma by dimini171
rewrite of the original, now more like an actual language than a preprocessor. 

# what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.   
it aims to be a wrapper for python with a slightly edited syntax. 
it tries to be very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.  

# syntax
head over to [syntax.md](https://github.com/mysteriousellipsis/sigma-lang/blob/v2/SYNTAX.md) to read more

# progress on stuff
## implemented
input output  
variables
