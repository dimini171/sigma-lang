# sigma by dimini171
rewrite of the [original](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1), now more like an actual language than a preprocessor. 

**this version of sigma is untested. a stable version can be found [here](https://github.com/dimini171/sigma/tree/v1)**

## known issues
if else statements dont work due to some problems with how the code is interpreted

## what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.   
it attempts to be a very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.   

## syntax
head over to [syntax.md](https://github.com/mysteriousellipsis/sigma/blob/v2/SYNTAX.md) to read more

## progress on stuff
