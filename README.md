# sigma by dimini171
full rewrite coming soon to fix my spagetthi code  

# what is this??
sigma lang was made for our final year computing coursework.   
it aims to be a wrapper for python with a slightly edited syntax. 
it tries to be very simple to understand and learn, especially for absolute beginners and people who want to pick up programming, but find it too confusing or difficult.  

# syntax
head over to [syntax.md](https://github.com/mysteriousellipsis/sigma-lang/blob/main/SYNTAX.md) to read more

# progress on stuff
## implemented
input output  
variables  
while loops  
break, continue, pass, etc  
goto  
conditionals  
making `print "text" <variable>` print properly


## in progress 
printing special characters  

## to be added
multiple statemnets in one line  
github yaml to automatically build an executable with pyinstaller   
~delete var and const?~
